This is a dataset of human activity recognition with selected features and each has a label telling what the subject is doing.

Hint: 
For the feature tBodyAcc-max()-X, which represents maximum body acceleration in X direction, the value will be relatively higher when walking downstairs. The value will be similar in walking and walking upstairs, but the value walking upstairs has slighly higher possibility larger than walking.

For the feature tGravityAcc-mean()-Z, which represents mean gravity acceleration in Z direction, this feature tells the posture of the subject. If the value is relatively high, it stands for the posture of the subject is more horizontal, meaning more likely the subject is laying. As the value goes low, the posture is more upright, so if the value is low (around negative to 0), meaning the subject is fully upright, meaning the subject is either standing or walking (including walking upstairs and downstairs). The value in between suggests the subject is sitting.

For the feature tBodyAccMag-mean(), which represents mean body acceleration magnitude, similar to tBodyAcc-max()-X, the value of walking downstairs is highest, then is walking upstairs, then is walking. Standing, laying, and sitting would have similar low value since they are not moving at all.
Notice that the raw data has a minus one bias, the value of static activity is -1 instead of 0, and value arond 0 shows quite strong movement already.

For the feature tBodyAccMag-std(), which represents standard deviation of body acceleration magnitude, has the same pattern of tBodyAccMag-mean(), can be used as double verification.

For the feature tGravityAccMag-std(), which represents standard deviation of gravity acceleration magnitude, has the same pattern as well. 

If given a series of data of above features, you can first look at tBodyAccMag-mean() to determine whether the subject is moving (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs) or static (Laying, Sitting, Standing), then check tGravityAcc-mean()-Z to tell the difference if the subject is static by posture. If the subject is moving, then you can look other features to reasoning the subject's actual activity.
