In the reference data, static activities (Standing, Sitting, Laying) have values close to –1 (e.g., –0.98 for Standing), whereas walking‑related activities show much less negative means (≈ –0.12 for ordinary Walking, –0.13 for Walking Upstairs, and –0.09 for Walking Downstairs).  \n   - The observed mean is therefore consistent with a moving state rather than a static posture.\n\n2. **Posture indicated by gravity**  \n   - `tGravityAcc-mean-Z` has a mean of –0.196, which is clearly negative. Negative values correspond to a more upright orientation (standing or walking), while positive values are typical for Sitting (≈ 0.33) or Laying (≈ 0.45).  \n   - The negative gravity Z therefore supports an upright, locomotion‑related activity.\n\n3. **Maximum acceleration in the X‑direction**  \n   - `tBodyAcc-max()-X` shows a positive mean of 0.055 (remember the raw bias of –1; a positive value indicates a relatively strong deviation from the static baseline). This is markedly higher than the small negative values recorded for Standing (≈ –0.94) and Sitting (≈ –0.94) and aligns with the higher X‑axis activity seen during walking.\n\n4. **Jerk magnitude**  \n   - `tBodyAccJerkMag-mean` is –0.321. For Walking Downstairs the jerk mean is close to zero (≈ –0.09), while Walking Upstairs shows a more negative jerk (≈ –0.47). The intermediate negative value of –0.321 suggests movement that is more vigorous than static activities but less abrupt than stair‑related locomotion.\n\nTaken together, the feature set indicates **moderate, upright movement** with noticeable acceleration in the X direction and a body‑acceleration magnitude that is far higher than static postures but not as extreme as stair‑related walking.

Our value (‑0.166) clearly departs from the static region.  \n- **Posture cue (tGravityAcc‑mean‑Z)** – Low or negative values (≈ 0 or slightly negative) denote an upright posture, which is typical for walking. Our small positive mean (0.033) is still near zero, indicating the device is not horizontally oriented (so it is not laying) and not strongly tilted (so it is not sitting).  \n- **Intensity cue (tBodyAcc‑max‑X)** – Walking‑downstairs produces the highest X‑axis peaks; standing, sitting, or laying show very negative peaks (≈ ‑0.9). The observed mean (‑0.014) is far from the static peaks and sits comfortably within the walking range reported in the source material.  \n\nPutting these clues together, the pattern matches a **dynamic, upright, moderate‑intensity** activity – exactly what the reference describes for **Walking**.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference for the other classes  \n\n- **Standing / Sitting / Laying** – All show very negative *tBodyAcc‑max‑X* (≈ ‑0.9) and low movement magnitudes (‑0.8 to ‑0.9).  \n- **Walking_Upstairs** – Slightly higher *tGravityAcc‑mean‑Z* (around –0.07) and a less negative *tBodyAccMag‑mean* (≈ ‑0.13).  \n- **Walking_Downstairs** – Highest *tBodyAcc‑max‑X* values (often positive) and the least negative *tBodyAccMag‑mean* (closest to 0).  \n\nSince the current reading does not exhibit the extreme X‑axis peaks of downstairs walking, nor the strongly negative peaks of static postures, **Walking** is the best match.",
